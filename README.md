# Hand-written-digit-recognition

convl_nn_dig_clsfier.py :

    This hand written digit recognition is built using a Convolutional Neural Network. 
    This is written in Python programming language while making use of various functions provided in Tensorflow.
    This network works with images of size 28 px * 28 px.
    The data for both training and testing are the MNIST datasets.
    The accuracy of the model on the MNIST test data is about 99 percent.
    "cnn_screenshot_1.png" and "cnn_screenshot_2.png" are the screenshots of its execution.
