# Hand-written-digit-recognition

**convl_nn_dig_clsfier.py :**

    - This hand written digit recognition is built using a Convolutional Neural Network. 
    - This is written in Python programming language while making use of various functions provided in Tensorflow.
    - This network works with images of size 28 px * 28 px.
    - The data for both training and testing are the MNIST datasets.
    - The accuracy of the model on the MNIST test data is about 99 percent.
    - "cnn_screenshot_1.png" and "cnn_screenshot_2.png" are the screenshots of its execution.
